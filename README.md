# Header

i learnt a lot of new applications in this project, i faced some setbacks such as not getting results even when it seemed my code was correct, to correct this, i had to recheck my code and found that i had put a type element in js script tag with a value of text/js, which was disrupting the entire project, but after that, my calculator app seemed to work just fine. i also learnt you can use both id and class tags for the same element, got a better grasp on how to use the foreach function, and how to use the try and catch functions, and also how to use the hover element
